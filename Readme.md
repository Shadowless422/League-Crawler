# LoL Crawler
This is a data collector script that makes use of [RiotWatcher](https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher) to build a dataset containing specific data about each participant of a match. Those data are meant to feed a Neural Network to try to predict the outcome of a match starting from those data.

# Getting Started
## About the data collected
The data is retrieved directly from Riot APIs using 6 [RiotWatcher](https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher), a 7 really useful wrapper written in Python that implements a 8 naive rate limiter, which is needed since the free API Key that 9 Riot provides is limited 20 requests per 1 minute and 100 10 requests per 2 minutes 11 ([source](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/portal)). 12 All data is therefore of public domain and so it can be accessed 13 by anyone.

## Requirements
[Python Dotenv Library](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv) 9 is needed to load the environment variables (for this project, 10 the API key).

[RiotWatcher](https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher) is
needed to do the API calls.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting up API key
To being able to use this script you must get an API key from 18 [Riot Games](https://developer.riotgames.com/). To use it you 19 need to put it in a file called ".env" on the script folder this way:
```
API_KEY="RGAPI-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee"
```


## Building the dataset
To build the .json database you need to run the function build_player_list(). 25 The main.py contains an example of a complete set of commands to build the dataset 26 and exporting it to 

## Exporting the dataset to .csv
To export the data inside the .json database [...]

### CSV details
The .csv file won't have an header. Each row contains all the data about one or both teams, the last element being the result. 

If each row contains data about both teams, the data about the blue team is on the first half. The result is 1 if the blue team won, 0 if not.

If each row contains data about a single team, the odd rows will contain  the data about the blue team, the even rows will contain the data about the red team of each match (i.e.: same match, row 1 blue team data, row 2 red team data).
